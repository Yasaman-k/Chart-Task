## How to run the project

1. Install dependencies
   - `npm install`
2. Run project in dev mode
   - `npm run start`

## Task Definition

#### Dynamic Chart:

Create a React application that generates a dynamic chart using either SVG or Canvas.
The chart should plot a series of (x, y) data points provided in an array.
The chart should update dynamically if the data changes.

#### Zoom Tool:

Implement a zoom tool similar to the selection tool in Windows when selecting multiple items on the desktop.
The user should be able to click and drag to create a rectangular selection area.
The chart should zoom into the area selected by the user without losing quality.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Correctness and functionality of the dynamic chart.
2. Usability and smoothness of the zoom tool.
3. Code quality and adherence to best practices.
4. Clarity and completeness of the README file.
5. Overall user experience of the application.

## ðŸ”¥ Improvement Opportunities

Enhance the zoom speed when clicking and dragging to create a selection rectangle on a large dataset.
